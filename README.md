# Eat, Lift, Pray 💪🏽

Eat, Lift, Pray is a Client-Trainer application where you as a client can choose your celebrity trainer of choice and book a session with your workout preference (cardio, weight lifting, etc), session duration, specific date and time for appointment. A user books a session by either loging into their account or creating an account. Afterwards, users can make appointments for a session (POST), change your session (PATCH), or if you can no longer attend your session then you can cancel as well (DELETE). A user's booked sessions can be seen when they are logged in to their account.

This is Eat Lift Pray's backend repository. Please go [here](https://github.com/pastasauce59/eat-lift-pray-frontend) for the frontend repository.
